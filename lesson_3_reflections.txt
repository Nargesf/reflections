1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Whenever you think your project is in a kinda stable position, and you want to publish it or share it
  with others remotely.

 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	There might always be some chnges you don't want to publish online, and also some changes you have online and don't want to be in your local directory.
